		<h3>Ways you can reduce your exposure</h3>
		<p>The most effective way to reduce your exposure to pet allergens is to avoid those animals. If you know you

		<p>Even after taking these steps, it may take months before allergen levels are reduced. Make sure you take your

		<p>If problems continue, unfortunately the only long-term solution may be to relocate your pet away from your
			home.</p>
